# Ghostly Shapes

## About

An interactive installation that detects shapes drawn on a physical canvas and then animates them onto a digital canvas. The program (built with Processing) gets imagery from the computer's webcam and compares the values of each individual pixel to define the outlines of the shapes. Those are rendered onto the screen with screensaver like animations.
